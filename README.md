# software-defined-radio-with-matlab
This is the repository for the software-defined radio (SDR) simulation using Matlab.
The codes model the SDR fundamental building blocks of transmitter and receiver, e.g., encoder/decoder, clock recovery, filter, etc.
In addition to that, it also models the channel and its nonideal conditions which affect the communication.

The textbook used is
